Ex03 - Remove Duplicates

Description:
    Write a program that asks the user to enter several numbers
    separated by spaces, stores them in a list, removes any
    duplicate values, and then prints the list without duplicates.

Requirements:
    - Ask the user for input (numbers separated by spaces).
    - Split the input into a list of strings.
    - Convert each item to a number (int or float).
    - Remove duplicate values.
    - Print the final list without duplicates.

Notes:
    The order of the numbers does not matter for this exercise.

Example:
    Enter numbers separated by spaces:
    2 4 2 6 4 8

    List without duplicates: [2, 4, 6, 8]
