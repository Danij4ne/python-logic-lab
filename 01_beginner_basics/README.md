# 01 - Beginner Basics

This module establishes the foundational logic used throughout the rest of the repository.  
The focus is on understanding how small, simple programs are built and how basic Python constructs interact to form complete behavior.

The exercises in this module are short, direct, and designed to work with one core idea at a time.

## 1. Variables, Input, and Output

### Purpose
This section introduces the most essential interaction in programming: receiving information and producing a result.

### Concepts Addressed
- Reading values from the console using `input()`
- Storing information in variables
- Displaying output with `print()`
- Working with basic text and numeric values

### Practical Use
These fundamentals appear in almost every program, regardless of size or complexity. Understanding them is key before moving into logic or decision-making.

### Exercises
- `ex01_hello_name.py`
- `ex02_sum_two_numbers.py`
- `ex03_simple_calculator.py`

---

## 2. Conditionals (if / elif / else)

### Purpose
This section focuses on decision-making—how a program chooses one path or action over another based on a condition.

### Concepts Addressed
- Boolean logic and comparison
- Branching execution using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Simple validation and classification

### Practical Use
Conditionals allow a program to react differently depending on input or state, forming the basis for authentication, filtering, and rule-based logic.

### Exercises
- `ex01_even_or_odd.py`
- `ex02_grade_classifier.py`
- `ex03_login_simulator.py`

---

## 3. Loops (for / while)

### Purpose
This section introduces repetition: performing the same action multiple times until a goal is reached.

### Concepts Addressed
- Iterating with `for`
- Repeating until a condition with `while`
- Counting, accumulating, and generating structured output

### Practical Use
Loops are central to automation, data processing, and any task involving repetition or iteration.

### Exercises
- `ex01_count_1_to_10.py`
- `ex02_sum_until_zero.py`
- `ex03_multiplication_table.py`

---

## 4. Basic Collections

### Purpose
This section shifts from single values to working with multiple pieces of data at once.

### Concepts Addressed
- Lists as a way to store multiple values
- Splitting and transforming input
- Extracting meaningful information (min, max, average)
- Removing duplicate items

### Practical Use
Collections are the foundation of data handling, analytics, and most real-world applications where information comes in groups rather than isolated values.

### Exercises
- `ex01_list_sum_average.py`
- `ex02_find_max_min.py`
- `ex03_remove_duplicates.py`

---

## 5. Simple Functions

### Purpose
This section introduces structured logic by grouping instructions into reusable units.

### Concepts Addressed
- Defining functions with `def`
- Parameters and return values
- Separating logic from user interaction
- Calling functions to organize code flow

### Practical Use
Functions allow code to stay clean, modular, and easier to maintain—an essential skill before moving into larger programs or advanced topics.

### Exercises
- `ex01_add_function.py`
- `ex02_is_prime_basic.py`
- `ex03_temperature_converter.py`

## Module Summary

This module acts as the entry point to the repository.  
It establishes:
- Clear input/output handling
- Basic decision-making
- Repetition and iteration
- Handling multiple values
- Organized logic through functions

These fundamentals form the groundwork required for the more complex tasks, data structures, and problem-solving found in later modules.
