Python Logic Lab is a structured programming repository designed to organize and develop Python problem-solving skills across five progressive levels. Each level contains exercises or projects focused on specific areas of logic, algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, and real-world console applications.

The repository is organized for clarity, scalability, and professional presentation, making it suitable as a portfolio reference.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a well-structured collection of Python logic challenges and small projects that demonstrate progressive problem-solving ability, code organization, and understanding of core programming concepts. It functions as a personal portfolio asset that reflects consistent development across multiple areas of Python.

## Level Overview

### **01 — Beginner Basics**
Focuses on fundamental programming concepts:
- Variables and input/output
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Basic collections
- Simple functions

### **02 — Intermediate Core**
Builds essential logic and data-processing skills:
- Nested loops
- Collections (lists, dicts, sets)
- String parsing
- File processing
- Functions and modular code

### **03 — Advanced OOP and Patterns**
Introduces object-oriented design and advanced Python mechanisms:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Error handling and custom exceptions
- Iterators and generators
- Decorators

### **04 — Interview Challenges**
Covers classic coding problems found in technical interviews:
- Arrays and strings
- Linked lists and custom structures
- Recursion and backtracking
- Search and sorting algorithms
- Mixed logic puzzles

### **05 — Mixed Projects**
Applies programming concepts in full mini-projects:
- Text-based menus
- Task management CLI
- Grade tracking system
- Number guessing game

---

## Conventions and Standards

- All exercise and project files use English naming and documentation.
- Each level includes its own README.md describing its contents.
- Code follows a consistent structure, using:
  - Clear filenames
  - TODO sections when applicable
  - Single-responsibility files

---

## Recommended Usage

- Navigate through levels in order, or explore specific topics as needed.
- Treat each file as a standalone challenge or project.
- Use the structure as a base for expansion, experimentation, and future additions.
