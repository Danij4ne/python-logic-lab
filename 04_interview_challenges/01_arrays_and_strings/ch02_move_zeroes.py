CH02 - Move Zeroes

Description:
    Given a list of numbers, move all zeroes to the end of the list
    while keeping the order of the non-zero elements the same.

Requirements:
    - Create a list of numbers (hard-coded or user input).
    - Move all elements equal to 0 to the end.
    - Keep the relative order of non-zero elements.
    - Print the list before and after the transformation.

Notes:
    - Try to solve it without creating a completely new list
      (in-place modification is preferred, but not mandatory).
    - This is a common array manipulation interview question.

Example:
    Input:
    [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]

    Output:
    [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
