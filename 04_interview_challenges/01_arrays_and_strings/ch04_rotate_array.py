CH04 - Rotate Array

Description:
    Given a list of numbers, rotate the list to the right by K steps.
    Rotating means that elements shifted out on the right reappear
    at the beginning of the list.

Requirements:
    - Create a list of numbers (hard-coded or user input).
    - Define a value K (number of rotation steps).
    - Rotate the list to the right by K positions.
    - Print the list before and after rotation.

Notes:
    - The rotation can be done step-by-step or using index logic.
    - K may be greater than the length of the list (handle this by using modulo if desired).
    - Do NOT use built-in rotation functions.

Example:
    Input:
    Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    K: 3

    Output:
    [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
