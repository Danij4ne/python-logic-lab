# 04 - Interview Challenges

This module focuses on classic programming problems commonly asked in technical interviews.  
The exercises emphasize logical reasoning, data manipulation, recursion, performance, and problem-solving strategies—without relying on external files or built-in shortcuts.

The goal is to develop confidence in breaking down problems and implementing clean, structured solutions.

## 1. Arrays and Strings

### Purpose
This section covers essential operations on sequences, which form the basis of many interview questions.

### Concepts Addressed
- Pair searching
- In-place modifications
- Substring analysis
- Rotating lists

### Practical Use
Arrays and strings are core data structures in nearly every application and are frequently tested in coding interviews.

### Exercises
- `ch01_two_sum.py`
- `ch02_move_zeroes.py`
- `ch03_longest_substring_without_repeating.py`
- `ch04_rotate_array.py`

## 2. Linked Lists and Custom Structures

### Purpose
This section introduces manually constructed data structures to simulate memory-linked behavior.

### Concepts Addressed
- Node-based structures
- Head pointers and traversal
- Pointer manipulation
- Merging and cycle detection

### Practical Use
Linked lists appear in system design, memory management, and foundational CS problems, making them a common interview topic.

### Exercises
- `ch01_reverse_linked_list.py`
- `ch02_detect_cycle.py`
- `ch03_merge_two_sorted_lists.py`

## 3. Recursion and Backtracking

### Purpose
This section explores recursive thinking and decision-making through backtracking.

### Concepts Addressed
- Recursive function design
- Base cases and recursive cases
- Memoization
- Backtracking strategies

### Practical Use
Recursion and backtracking are often used in search problems, puzzle-solving, and tree/graph algorithms.

### Exercises
- `ch01_factorial_recursive.py`
- `ch02_fibonacci_memoization.py`
- `ch03_n_queens_simplified.py`

## 4. Search and Sort

### Purpose
This section focuses on two of the most fundamental algorithm categories in computer science.

### Concepts Addressed
- Binary search
- Performance through divide-and-conquer
- Manual sorting logic
- Algorithmic efficiency

### Practical Use
Sorting and searching algorithms form the basis for optimization in databases, operating systems, and large-scale applications.

### Exercises
- `ch01_binary_search.py`
- `ch02_bubble_sort.py`
- `ch03_quick_sort.py`

## 5. Mixed Logic Puzzles

### Purpose
This section applies logic to scenarios that combine reasoning, constraints, and data manipulation.

### Concepts Addressed
- Condition-based rules
- Interval checking
- Overlap detection
- Data range merging

### Practical Use
Logic puzzles train the ability to reason through constraints—a key skill in interviews and real-world problem-solving.

### Exercises
- `ch01_fizzbuzz_variations.py`
- `ch02_meeting_rooms_overlap.py`
- `ch03_interval_merge.py`
