CH02 - Detect Cycle in a Linked List

Description:
    Implement logic to detect whether a singly linked list contains
    a cycle (loop). A cycle exists if a node's "next" pointer eventually
    points back to a previous node instead of reaching None.

Requirements:
    - Define a Node class.
    - Define a LinkedList class with a head pointer.
    - Implement a method has_cycle() that returns True if a cycle exists,
      False otherwise.
    - Demonstrate both cases:
        - A normal list with no cycle.
        - A list where the last node points back to a previous node.

Notes:
    - You may use the "fast and slow pointer" technique (optional).
    - Do NOT use Python lists or sets to track visited nodes (optional challenge).

Example (expected behavior):
    List without cycle: False
    List with cycle: True

# TODO:
# 1. Define Node and LinkedList classes.
# 2. Implement has_cycle() to detect if a cycle exists.
# 3. Demonstrate the method on both a normal and a cyclic list.
