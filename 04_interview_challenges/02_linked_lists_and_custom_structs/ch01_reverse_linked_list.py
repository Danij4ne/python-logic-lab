CH01 - Reverse a Linked List

Description:
    Implement a simple singly linked list and write logic to reverse it.
    The goal is to reverse the order of the nodes so that the last
    becomes first, and so on.

Requirements:
    - Define a Node class with:
        - a value
        - a next pointer (default: None)
    - Create a LinkedList class with:
        - a head pointer
        - a method to add nodes
        - a method to print the list
    - Implement a method reverse() that reverses the linked list.
    - Demonstrate the before and after states.

Notes:
    - No built-in Python lists for reversing.
    - The logic should use pointer manipulation.

Example (expected behavior):
    Original: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None
    Reversed: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None

# 1. Define the Node class.
# 2. Define the LinkedList class with add, print, and reverse methods.
# 3. Build a sample list.
# 4. Reverse it and print both versions.
