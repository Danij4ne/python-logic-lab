CH03 - Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists

Description:
    Given two singly linked lists that are already sorted in ascending order,
    merge them into a single sorted linked list.

Requirements:
    - Define a Node class.
    - Define a LinkedList class with:
        - a head pointer
        - a method to add nodes
        - a method to print the list
    - Implement a function merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2) that:
        - takes the heads of two sorted linked lists
        - returns the head of a new merged sorted list
    - Demonstrate the result by printing the merged list.

Notes:
    - The merge should be done by rearranging pointers,
      not by converting to Python lists.
    - Both lists may have different lengths.

Example (expected behavior):
    List 1: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> None
    List 2: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> None

    Merged: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> None
