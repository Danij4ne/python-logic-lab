CH01 - Binary Search

Description:
    Implement binary search to find a target value inside a sorted list.
    Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Requirements:
    - Create a sorted list of numbers.
    - Define a target value to search for.
    - Use binary search (NOT linear search).
    - If the target is found, print its index.
    - If not found, print a message indicating that.

Notes:
    - No built-in search functions.
    - Use a loop or recursion.
    - The list must be sorted for binary search to work.

Example:
    Numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
    Target: 7

    Output:
    Found at index 3
