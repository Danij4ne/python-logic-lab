CH03 - Quick Sort

Description:
    Implement the Quick Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers
    in ascending order. Quick Sort works by selecting a pivot and
    dividing the list into smaller sublists based on the pivot.

Requirements:
    - Create an unsorted list of numbers.
    - Implement Quick Sort using recursion.
    - The function should:
        - choose a pivot
        - partition the remaining elements into two lists:
            - elements less than or equal to the pivot
            - elements greater than the pivot
        - recursively sort the sublists
        - combine the results
    - Print the list before and after sorting.

Notes:
    - Do NOT use built-in sorting functions like sort() or sorted().
    - You may choose any pivot strategy (e.g., first element).
    - This exercise focuses on divide-and-conquer logic.

Example:
    Input:
    [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]

    Output:
    [1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
