CH02 - Bubble Sort

Description:
    Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers
    in ascending order. Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent
    elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Requirements:
    - Create an unsorted list of numbers (hard-coded or user input).
    - Implement Bubble Sort using nested loops.
    - Sort the list in ascending order.
    - Print the list before and after sorting.

Notes:
    - Do NOT use built-in sorting functions like sort() or sorted().
    - Bubble Sort is not efficient, but it is a common interview exercise
      for understanding sorting logic.

Example:
    Input:
    [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]

    Output:
    [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]

# 3. Continue until the list is fully sorted.
# 4. Print the list before and after sorting.
