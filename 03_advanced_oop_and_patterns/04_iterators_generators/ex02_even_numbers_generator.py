Ex02 - Even Numbers Generator

Description:
    Create a generator function that yields even numbers starting from 0
    up to a given limit (inclusive or exclusive is your choice).

Requirements:
    - Define a generator function named even_numbers(limit).
    - The function should yield even numbers: 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
    - Stop when the limit is reached or passed.
    - In the main part of the script, call the generator
      and print each generated number.

Notes:
    - The limit can be hard-coded; no user input is required.
    - A generator uses the 'yield' keyword instead of returning all values at once.

Example (expected behavior):
    0
    2
    4
    6
    8
