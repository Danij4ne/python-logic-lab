Ex02 - Logger Decorator

Description:
    Create a decorator that logs when a function is called,
    including the function name and the arguments passed to it.

Requirements:
    - Define a decorator named logger.
    - The decorator should:
        - print the function name
        - print the arguments received
        - call the wrapped function
    - Apply the decorator to at least one function
      (for example, a simple math function).
    - Run the decorated function to demonstrate the logging.

Notes:
    - You may print arguments using *args and **kwargs.
    - The focus is on observing function calls through the decorator.

Example (expected behavior):
    Calling function: add
    Arguments: 5, 7
    Result: 12
