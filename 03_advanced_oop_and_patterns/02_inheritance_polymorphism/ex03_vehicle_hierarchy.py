Ex03 - Vehicle Class Hierarchy

Description:
    Create a base class Vehicle and two subclasses: Car and Motorcycle.
    Each subclass should have its own specific behavior or attribute.

Requirements:
    - Define a base class named Vehicle.
    - The Vehicle class should have:
        - a brand attribute
        - a model attribute
        - a method display_info() that prints brand and model
    - Create a subclass Car that:
        - inherits from Vehicle
        - has an additional attribute, for example: doors
        - overrides display_info() to include the number of doors
    - Create a subclass Motorcycle that:
        - inherits from Vehicle
        - has an additional attribute, for example: has_sidecar (True/False)
        - overrides display_info() to include sidecar information
    - In the main part of the script, create a Car and a Motorcycle
      and call display_info() on both.

Notes:
    - The focus is on inheritance and method overriding.
    - Attributes can be hard-coded; no user input is required.

Example (expected behavior):
    Car: Toyota Corolla, Doors: 4
    Motorcycle: Harley Davidson, Sidecar: False
