Ex02 - Employee and Manager (Inheritance)

Description:
    Create a base class Employee and a subclass Manager.
    The Manager class should extend Employee by adding additional
    responsibilities or attributes.

Requirements:
    - Define a base class named Employee.
    - The Employee class should have:
        - name and salary attributes
        - a method display_info() that prints name and salary
    - Create a subclass Manager that:
        - inherits from Employee
        - has an additional attribute, for example: department
        - overrides display_info() to include the department
    - In the main part of the script, create an Employee and a Manager,
      then call display_info() on both objects.

Notes:
    - The salary can be any number.
    - The department can be a simple string.

Example (expected behavior):
    Name: Alice, Salary: 3000
    Name: Bob, Salary: 5000, Department: Sales
