Ex02 - Bank Account Class

Description:
    Create a BankAccount class that represents a simple bank account
    with basic deposit and withdrawal operations.

Requirements:
    - Define a class named BankAccount.
    - The class should have:
        - an __init__ method that receives an initial balance (default 0).
        - an attribute to store the balance.
        - a deposit(amount) method that increases the balance.
        - a withdraw(amount) method that decreases the balance
          if there are enough funds.
        - a get_balance() method that returns the current balance.
    - In the main part of the script, create a BankAccount object
      and demonstrate deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.

Notes:
    - Withdrawals should not allow the balance to go negative.
    - You may print a message if the withdrawal cannot be completed.

Example (expected behavior):
    Balance: 0
    Depositing 100...
    Balance: 100
    Withdrawing 40...
    Balance: 60
