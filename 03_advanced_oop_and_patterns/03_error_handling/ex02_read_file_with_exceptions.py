Ex02 - Read File with Exception Handling

Description:
    Write a program that asks for a file name and attempts to open it.
    If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, handle the error
    using try/except and print a friendly message instead of crashing.

Requirements:
    - Ask the user for a file name.
    - Use try/except when opening the file.
    - If successful, read and print the file's contents.
    - If an exception occurs, print an error message.

Notes:
    - This exercise focuses on handling common file-related errors.
    - No need to process the file contents beyond printing them.

Example (expected behavior):
    Enter file name:
    data.txt

    (prints file contents)

    Or if the file does not exist:

    Error: could not open the file
"""

# TODO:
# 1. Ask the user for a file name.
# 2. Use try/except when opening the file.
# 3. Print the contents if successful.
# 4. Print an error message if opening fails.
