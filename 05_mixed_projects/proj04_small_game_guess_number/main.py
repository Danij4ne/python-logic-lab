Project 04 - Guess the Number Game

Description:
    Create a simple console game where the computer selects
    a random number and the player has to guess it.

Requirements:
    - The program should:
        - Choose a random number within a range (for example, 1 to 100).
        - Ask the player to guess the number.
        - After each guess, tell the player if the guess is:
            - too low
            - too high
            - correct
        - Count how many attempts the player needed.
        - End the game when the player guesses correctly and
          display the number of attempts.

Notes:
    - Use the random module to generate the secret number.
    - Input should be read from the console.
    - Handle non-numeric input gracefully (optional).

Example (expected behavior):
    I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
    Take a guess: 50
    Too high!
    Take a guess: 25
    Too low!
    Take a guess: 37
    Correct! You needed 3 attempts.
