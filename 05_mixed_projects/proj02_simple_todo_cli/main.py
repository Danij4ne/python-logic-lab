Project 02 - Simple TODO CLI

Description:
    Create a simple command-line TODO application that allows the user
    to add, list, and remove tasks during a single program execution.

Requirements:
    - Maintain a list of tasks in memory (no files required).
    - Show a small menu with options such as:
        1. Add a new task
        2. List all tasks
        3. Remove a task by its number or name
        4. Exit
    - Use a loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.
    - Handle invalid options and invalid task selections gracefully.

Notes:
    - Tasks can be simple strings.
    - Focus on list manipulation, input handling, and control flow.

Example (expected behavior):
    === TODO MENU ===
    1. Add task
    2. List tasks
    3. Remove task
    4. Exit

    Select an option: 1
    Enter new task: Buy groceries

    Select an option: 2
    1. Buy groceries
