# 05 - Mixed Projects

This module contains small, self-contained console applications that combine control flow, input handling, data structures, and basic logic. Each project is structured as a standalone script, representing a simplified real-world scenario.

The focus is on organizing program logic into complete workflows rather than isolated exercises.

## 1. Text Menu Application

### Purpose
A basic menu-driven console program that allows users to select actions and trigger different behaviors.

### Concepts Addressed
- Menu loops
- Input handling
- Branching logic
- Structured program flow

### Practical Use
Menu-driven programs are common in command-line tools, administrative scripts, and prototype interfaces.

### Project File
- `proj01_text_menu_app/main.py`

---

## 2. Simple TODO CLI

### Purpose
A minimal task management system that maintains a list of tasks during execution.

### Concepts Addressed
- List manipulation
- Adding and removing items
- Repetitive user interaction
- Program state stored in memory

### Practical Use
Command-line TODO tools form the basis for larger task managers and productivity applications.

### Project File
- `proj02_simple_todo_cli/main.py`

## 3. Student Grades Manager

### Purpose
A console application to store students and their grades, and retrieve simple statistics.

### Concepts Addressed
- Dictionary-based data structures
- Data organization
- Basic computations
- Validation and error handling

### Practical Use
This structure reflects the foundations of data management systems and record-based applications.

### Project File
- `proj03_student_grades_manager/main.py`

---

## 4. Guess the Number Game

### Purpose
A number-guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number.

### Concepts Addressed
- Random number generation
- Repetitive guessing loop
- Conditional feedback
- Attempt tracking

### Practical Use
This pattern appears in simple games, simulations, and input-based decision workflows.

### Project File
- `proj04_small_game_guess_number/main.py`

## Module Summary

This module emphasizes:

- Building complete program flows
- Managing state and user interaction
- Structuring logic into cohesive applications
- Working with fundamental Python constructs in practical scenarios

These small projects provide a foundation for larger applications and can serve as portfolio-ready examples of functional program design.
