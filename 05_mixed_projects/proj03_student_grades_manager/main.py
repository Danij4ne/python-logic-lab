Project 03 - Student Grades Manager

Description:
    Create a console application to manage students and their grades.
    The program should allow adding students, assigning grades,
    and viewing basic statistics.

Requirements:
    - Store students and their grades in a suitable data structure
      (for example, a dictionary: { "Alice": [8.5, 9.0], ... }).
    - Provide a menu with options such as:
        1. Add a student
        2. Add a grade to a student
        3. List all students and their grades
        4. Show average grade for a student
        5. Exit
    - Handle cases where:
        - A student does not exist.
        - A student has no grades yet.

Notes:
    - All data can be stored in memory (no files required).
    - The focus is on collections, loops, and basic calculations.

Example (expected behavior):
    === GRADES MANAGER ===
    1. Add student
    2. Add grade
    3. List students
    4. Show student average
    5. Exit

    Select an option: 1
    Enter student name: Alice

    Select an option: 2
    Enter student name: Alice
    Enter grade: 9.0
