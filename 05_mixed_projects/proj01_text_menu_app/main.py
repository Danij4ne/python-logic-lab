Project 01 - Text Menu Application

Description:
    Create a simple console-based menu system that allows the user
    to select from multiple options and perform basic actions.

Requirements:
    - Display a menu with several numbered options (e.g., 1, 2, 3...).
    - Use a loop to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit.
    - Handle invalid menu selections gracefully.
    - Implement at least three actions, such as:
        - Printing a message
        - Performing a simple calculation
        - Showing a list of items
    - Include an option to exit the program.

Notes:
    - User input is required for menu selections.
    - The focus is on control flow, loops, and program structure.

Example (expected behavior):
    === MENU ===
    1. Say Hello
    2. Add Two Numbers
    3. Show Items
    4. Exit

    Select an option: 1
    Hello!

    Select an option: 4
    Exiting...
