Description:
    Write a program that asks the user for a number N
    and prints an N x N square made of a chosen character.
    Use nested loops to generate the pattern.

Requirements:
    - Ask the user for a number N (size of the square).
    - Ask the user for a character or symbol.

Example:
    Enter size:

    Enter character:
    *

    ****
    ****
