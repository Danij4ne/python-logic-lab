Ex02 - Simple Statistics Module

Description:
    Write a program that defines a small statistics module
    containing the following functions:
        - calculate_sum(numbers)
        - calculate_average(numbers)
        - calculate_max(numbers)
        - calculate_min(numbers)

    Then, ask the user for a list of numbers, call these functions,
    and print the results.

Requirements:
    - Define four functions, each receiving a list of numbers.
    - Each function should return the corresponding result.
    - Ask the user for numbers separated by spaces.
    - Convert the input into a list of numbers.
    - Call each function and print the outputs.

Notes:
    - No built-in functions like sum(), max(), or min() are required,
      but they may be used if desired.
    - Assume the user enters at least one number.

Example:
    Enter numbers:
    4 8 2 6

    Sum: 20
    Average: 5.0
    Max: 8
    Min: 2
