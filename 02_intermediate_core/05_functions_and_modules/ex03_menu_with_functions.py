Ex03 - Menu Program Using Functions

Description:
    Write a program that displays a simple text-based menu
    with multiple options. Each option should trigger a different
    function. The menu should repeat until the user chooses to exit.

Requirements:
    - Define separate functions for each menu option.
      (For example: say_hello(), show_date(), etc.)
    - Display a menu with numbered choices.
    - Ask the user to select an option.
    - Call the corresponding function based on the choice.
    - Repeat the menu until the user chooses an exit option.
    - Print a message when exiting the program.

Notes:
    - The functions can perform simple actions.
    - The focus is on organizing code and controlling program flow.

Example (Simplified):
    1. Say Hello
    2. Show Info
    3. Exit

    Enter option:
    1

    Hello!
"""

# TODO:
# 1. Define at least two functions for menu actions.
# 2. Create a loop that displays the menu and asks for a choice.
# 3. Call the correct function based on the user's selection.
# 4. Stop the loop when the exit option is chosen.
# 5. Print a goodbye message when exiting.
