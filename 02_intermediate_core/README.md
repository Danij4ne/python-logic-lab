# 02 - Intermediate Core

This module expands on the foundational concepts from the beginner level and moves into more structured, realistic problem-solving.  
The focus is on working with multiple data elements, nested logic, text processing, file handling, and organizing functionality into reusable components.

The exercises in this module involve longer thought processes and introduce patterns commonly found in real-world programming tasks.

## 1. Nested Loops

### Purpose
This section explores situations where one loop operates inside another, allowing multi-dimensional output and repeated patterns.

### Concepts Addressed
- Looping inside another loop
- Generating structured patterns and grids
- Using indices for rows and columns

### Practical Use
Nested loops are frequently used in matrix operations, 2D data structures, pattern generation, and algorithmic problem-solving.

### Exercises
- `ex01_print_square_pattern.py`
- `ex02_multiplication_table_matrix.py`
- `ex03_triangle_stars.py`

## 2. Lists, Dictionaries, and Sets

### Purpose
This section focuses on handling collections of data and selecting the most suitable structure for each task.

### Concepts Addressed
- Lists for ordered data
- Dictionaries for key-value mapping
- Sets for unique elements
- Counting, filtering, and transforming data

### Practical Use
These structures are central to data processing, analytics, configuration storage, and efficient lookup operations.

### Exercises
- `ex01_word_frequency_counter.py`
- `ex02_unique_elements_set.py`
- `ex03_invert_dictionary.py`

## 3. Strings and Parsing

### Purpose
This section deals with analyzing and transforming text, a common requirement in many software systems.

### Concepts Addressed
- Text normalization
- Character comparison
- Pattern-based logic
- Basic validation and matching

### Practical Use
String manipulation is vital in input validation, search features, data cleaning, and communication between systems.

### Exercises
- `ex01_is_palindrome.py`
- `ex02_anagram_checker.py`
- `ex03_email_validator_simple.py`

---

## 4. Files and Loops

### Purpose
This section introduces reading information from external files and processing it line by line.

### Concepts Addressed
- Opening and reading files
- Iterating over file content
- Extracting specific information
- Simple text-based analysis

### Practical Use
File processing is used in log analysis, data import pipelines, configuration management, and automation scripts.

### Exercises
- `ex01_count_lines_in_file.py`
- `ex02_find_word_in_file.py`
- `ex03_log_simple_analyzer.py`

---

## 5. Functions and Modules

### Purpose
This section emphasizes structuring code into reusable components and organizing logic into smaller, focused parts.

### Concepts Addressed
- Defining functions
- Returning values
- Separating concerns
- Basic modular organization

### Practical Use
Functions improve readability, maintainability, and scalability. They form the foundation for larger applications and modular architecture.

### Exercises
- `ex01_calculator_with_functions.py`
- `ex02_statistics_module.py`
- `ex03_menu_with_functions.py`

## Module Summary

This module builds confidence in handling more complex logic and multi-step problem-solving.  
It develops key skills in:

- Working with structured and unstructured data
- Building layered logic with nested loops
- Processing and transforming text
- Reading and analyzing files
- Organizing behavior through reusable functions

The concepts practiced here serve as a bridge between basic coding and the more advanced patterns, abstractions, and problem-solving challenges found in later modules.
