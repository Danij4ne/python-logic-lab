Ex02 - Find a Word in a File

Description:
    Write a program that asks the user for a file name
    and a word to search for. The program should open the file,
    count how many times the word appears, and print the result.

Requirements:
    - Ask the user for a file name.
    - Ask the user for a word to search for.
    - Open the file in read mode.
    - Loop through the file line by line.
    - Count how many times the word appears.
    - Print the total occurrences.

Notes:
    - The search can be case-sensitive.
    - A simple string search is enough for this exercise.

Example:
    Enter file name:
    sample.txt
    Enter word to search:
    python

    "python" found 3 times.
